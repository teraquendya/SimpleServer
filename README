2) Unzip all files into the same directory as minecraft_server.jar
3) Run launch.bat or launch.sh to start the server for the first time
4) Press "Enter" at the console (which is informing you that you've started
   the server for the first time!)
5) Open simpleserver.properties and adjust the values as needed
6) You can now connect to the server using your IP Address (www.whatismyip.com)
   and the port indicated in simpleserver.properties!

Features (See CHANGES for updates):
 * Denial of service protection.  More than 30 requests/IP/minute will
   automatically ban the IP.

   to place blocks, destroy blocks, or access chests.

 * Locked chests.  Each player can say !lock and place a single locked chest.
   Other non-admins cannot access or destroy the chest.

Technical Details:
  This wrapper works by proxying all network and console data to and from the
  minecraft server.  This means that your clients will be connecting to the
  wrapper and not to the minecraft server directly.
