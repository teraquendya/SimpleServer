 List of players and their group id, one per line.  Names are case-insensitive.
 Format: Name=GroupID

 Please note, if you have online mode disabled, names will not be verified with
 minecraft.net and users can login with any name they want.

 The GroupID must be defined in group-list.txt, and GroupID -1 is always
 treated as guests.

 Example: nOtCh=3 means Notch will be an admin
