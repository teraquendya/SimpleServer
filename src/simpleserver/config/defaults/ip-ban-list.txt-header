 List of IPs to ban, one per line.

 IPAddress can be specified as 1, 2, 3 or all 4 octets.  For instance
 10.0.0.128 defines a single IP and 10.0.0 will include every IP in the class C
 network 10.0.0.0/24.

 Please note that most residential internet connections are assigned dynamic IP
 addresses.  Some dynamic addresses change daily while others remain the same
 for months.  Proceed with caution if you are adding residential IP addresses
 to this file.
