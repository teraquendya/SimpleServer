== 7.1 (in-development) ==
 * Workaround 5 second timer in minecraft_server.jar by cycling through the
   entire 127.0.0.0/8 address space.  If you are running Windows XP SP2, you
   may need to install this patch from Microsoft.
   http://support.microsoft.com/kb/884020
 * Fix mod integration when useSlashes=true

== 7.0 ==
 * Updated to work with version 1.2
 * Changed iddqd to idbehold and added new iddqd that provides pvp protection
 * Fixed chest locking bugs

 * Added in-game command help (eg. !help iddqd)
 * Merged kit and kits commands
 * Changed tp to teleport (both will work but command-list will need an update)

   if there is a player of a lower group on the server, the player with the
   lowest group and the least time connected is kicked to make room.

 * Updated for 0.2.5 minecraft server.
 * Some performance-related changes.
 * Other stuff I forgot about?

== RC 6.4 ==

== RC 6.3 ==
 * It is a mystery!

== RC 6.2 ==

   Default value is false, which means guest users (group=-1) cannot view signs
   or chests.
 * Made compatible for minecraft_server.jar version 0.2.2

== RC 6.1.1 ==
 * Changed guest mode: Guests are now able to see signs, but are also able to
   look into and change items inside unlocked chests.

== RC 6.1 ==
 * Added useSMPAPI to simpleserver.properties to tell SimpleServer to pass
   unrecognized commands and other useful commands to the SMP API. Set to true
   if you are using the WarpMod

   would be indestructible.
 * Fixed an issue with !tp where it would not correctly use prefixed players
   names.

== RC 6.0.3 ==
 * Added useMsgFormats boolean to simpleserver.properties. Enables/disables
   SimpleServer message formatting.
 * Added msgFormat and msgTitleFormat which sets the string format for player
   messages that have no title, and a user title, respectively.
     %1$s = Username
     %2$s = Group Title
     %3$s = Group Color
 * Changes backup routine so it copies files into /tmp instead of /backups.
   Backup ZIP files are still copied into /backups.

     c10tArgs=/path/to/c10t/executable -arg0 -arg1 -arg2 -arg3
     c10tMins=60
   Blanking c10tArgs will disable this feature until application is restarted.
   (Tip: This can be used for any mapping program that exits on completion and
   uses commandline.)
 * Added locked chests. Players are currently only able to create a single
   locked chest using !lock.

   than minecraft_server.jar

   over 1024 bytes
